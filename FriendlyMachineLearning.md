## Essential Questions
- How does artificial intelligence and machine learning work?
- How can computers learn to perform a task without being explicitly program to do so?
- What does it mean that a computer "learned" something?
- How can we benefit from machine learning?
- Why is training and bias so important when training an algorithm?
- What will be the impact of having machine learning algorithms?
- What kind of creative experiments can we do with machine learning?
- Can we use Javascript to create some simple machine learning projects in the browser?
- How can programming beginners without math or computer science background get started with machine learning?

## Introduction
Artificial intelligence (A.I), the concept that computers can do and perform tasks that will normally require human intelligence, is becoming more and more predominant in our society. We use artificial intelligence systems almost everyday: when translating a text in the internet, when we tag our friends in Facebook or when we search for directions in a map. 

A.I requires special systems and methodologies. One very popular technique to train computers to performs tasks is machine learning. Machine learning allows computer to perform functions and jobs without explicitly programming it to do so. 

This workshop will allow students to understand the basic principles behind machine learning using live demos. It is also meant to serve as a high level introduction to topics related A.I. A friendly JavaScript web framework for machine learning, called [ml5](ml5js.github.io), will be used to show and demonstrate examples and concepts.

The ml5 JavaScript library is a tool for educators to integrate machine learning concepts into introductory coding classes. Together with examples, tutorials, and datasets, the library’s goal is to make machine learning accessible to a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students (high school and university). The ml5 library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser with no other external dependencies.


### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This is intended for high school students between 10 and 18 years old, teachers who are interested in teaching introductions to machine learning in their classes, and any programming beginners who would like to learn more about machine learning. Some familiarity with basic concepts of programming can be helpful. 

### Pacing / Duration
While this session can work as an introduction class to various machine learning concepts, ideally students can continue exploring more creative uses of machine learning.

## Outcomes & Goals

After this workshop, students will - 
- Have a better understanding about some machine learning concepts and algorithms;
- Learn how to use a machine learning library called ml5.js;
- Be able to create some simple machine learning projects in the browser;
- Learn to make their own creative machine learning projects based the examples from ml5.js.

#### Vocabulary
* **AI**: Artificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)
* **Machine Learning**: Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
* **Deep Learning**: Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)
* **Nerual Network**: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)
* **Transfer Learning**: Transfer learning is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. 
* **KNN**: k-nearest neighbors algorithm. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
